After graduating I spent about eight or nine years as a Genetic Statistician trying to work out what genes are involved in complex diseases at various Universities, Manchester, Western Australia and then returning to Sheffield. I then shifted careers to work as a Medical Statistician for about nine years followed by four years in industry as a Data Scientist where I didn’t actually do much data science but did learn a lot about software development which is how I’ve ended up back at the University of Sheffield as a Research Software Engineer.\nA common theme from my Masters on-wards is that I have used computers to write programmes and analyse data. I’ve taught myself Linux system administration and from a rudimentary training on Fortran, C and Stata have gone on to learn Bash, R and Python as well as a few other bits and pieces of different languages.\nVery early on in my career I developed an interest in literate programming and reproducible research which is why Aneta has invited me her today to talk to you and I’ll expand on these topics and show you some work I’m currently engaged in and how I undertake it in a reproducible manner.\nReproducible Research is one of the foundational aspects of Open Research as by ensuring our work is reproducible and open to review it improves confidence in its accuracy and reliability."

    "text": "What’s Involved?\n\nLogical, ordered directory structure.\nScripts/code.\nVersion control of code.\nReproducible environment (R packages using renv).\n\n\nIt can seem overwhelming learning a new paradigm or framework for undertaking work and I’ve often found that people want to get on and do the work rather than take a step back and assess how they are going about it but its well worth taking the time out to review and assess your working practices and see how they can be improved.\nI’m going to walk you through a project that I’ve been working on that is looking to improve the prediction of Thyroid Cancer. Its not my own work, its the topic for a PhD for a clinicial Dr Ovie Edafe who is a specialist in neck cancers and related surgery.\nThere are four broad areas that I’ll cover that hopefully align with the content you have already covered and will be covering in the coming weeks.\nThe first step is having an organised structure to your directories having data organised in a consistent and structured manner makes it considerably easier to work with.\nYou then need to write code or scripts, which are still code, that defines the steps you undertake in cleaning and tidying your data and getting it ready for analysis before another series of scripts are used to run the analysis.\nAll of the code that is written should be version controlled which allos you to track the history of the code and see what changes have been made over time. If a mistake is made it is possible to revert back to a previous state where things did work. Version control and tools such as Git and GitHub make it much easier to collaborate with others on research too.\nOne final step is having a reproducible environment under which your work is undertaken. This means the specific versions of packages that you have used for analysis should be recorded and used again in the future. In R this can be done via the renv package. Its not without problems but the situation today is far better than it used to be."

This might be data from sensors that have captured data and if you work with this sort of data then its likely to be fairly well structured, but can also be the results of surveys that have been captured and stored in databases and then exported for you to work with. Depending on how well the data capture was setup you will almost invariably have to clean your data, in my experience about 80% of data analysis is cleaning the data and wrangling it such as deriving variables like age from date of birth, and on that note if you ever do want to analyse age as a variable try and capture date of birth as you can easily derive the age in years or categorise it into bins, but if you only ask people to say what age band they are in you can’t go back the other way. Common errors in data cleaning are having string characters in variables that are meant to be numeric, or having categorical variables where people haven’t entered the correct field and so you have to then work out how to tidy this which I’ll come on to.\nThe key thin is that its important to keep a record of the changes you make and these will be in R scripts or Markdown/Quarto files. And it therefore makes sense to separate your data from your scripts."
